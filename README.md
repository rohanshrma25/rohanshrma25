 Hi there! I'm Rohan Sharma, a passionate data enthusiast currently transitioning to a data analyst role

💼 Bringing nearly a year of experience in manufacturing, I am eager to apply my analytical skills in a full-fledged data analyst position.

🎓 I hold a degree in Mechanical Engineering and have honed my skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.

💡 Fascinated by the intersection of data and decision-making, I'm particularly interested in Data Visualisation & Supervised Machine Learning .

🌱 I'm always exploring new datasets and techniques to expand my knowledge and stay ahead in the dynamic world of data analysis.
