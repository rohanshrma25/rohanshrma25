 Hi there! I'm Rohan Sharma, a passionate data analyst with a knack for transforming raw data into actionable insights.

💼 Currently transitioning to a data analyst role, bringing almost a year of experience in manufacturing.

🎓 I hold a degree in Mechanical Engineering and have honed my skills in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau.

💡 Fascinated by the intersection of data and decision-making, I'm particularly interested in Data Visualisation & Supervised Machine Learning .
